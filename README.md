Note: This is a small project to test out the WPF views and explore the
MVVM architecture pattern. Plus, some Unit Tests.

Use purpose:
This app is a simple Calculator app with a MS SQL Server database
acting as data storage for the calculation results' data logs.

Project Structure:

This one is supposed to have 3 main modules + Unit Tests(MSTests), 
realizing the MVVM architecture pattern:

-DataModels
-Views
-ViewModels
-UnitTests

The DataModels ayer holds Entities for tables in the MS SQL Server database and
the mathematical models for basic algebra functions.
The ViewModels layer holds view templates and logic.
The Views layer is the WPF app itself.
Unit Tests are MSTests for classes in DataModels and ViewModels modules.
